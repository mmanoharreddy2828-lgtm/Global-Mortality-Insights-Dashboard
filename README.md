# Global Mortality Insights Dashboard

An interactive dashboard analyzing global mortality trends and causes across multiple countries from 2015 to 2025. This project provides comprehensive data visualization with statistics on mortality rates by country, gender, age group, and cause of death.

## Overview

This dashboard offers insights into global mortality patterns, helping researchers, public health professionals, and analysts understand death trends across different demographics and regions. It combines data visualization with statistical analysis to identify patterns and trends in mortality data.

## Features

- **Deaths by Country**: Visualization of total deaths across major countries
- **Mortality Rate by Age Group**: Analysis of death rates across different age groups
- **Gender Analysis**: Comparison of mortality between males and females
- **Cause of Death Analysis**: Breakdown of deaths by primary causes including:
  - Cancer
  - Cardiovascular Disease
  - Diabetes
  - Infectious Diseases
  - Natural Disasters
  - Road Accidents
  - Suicide
  - Respiratory Diseases
  - Homicide
  - Kidney Disease
  - Stroke

## Data Coverage

- **Time Period**: 2015-2025
- **Countries Included**: China, Germany, India, Japan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, UK, USA, Brazil
- **Age Groups**: 0-14, 15-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+
- **Total Deaths Analyzed**: 67,000,578

## Dataset

The project includes a synthetic dataset (`deaths_and_causes_synthetic.csv`) containing:
- Year of death
- Country
- Gender (Male/Female)
- Age Group
- Cause of Death
- Number of Deaths
